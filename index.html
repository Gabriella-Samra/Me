                        At Luxtripper I wore many hats and kept up with the demands of a challenging, fast paced startup
                        environment. I employed
                        waterfall, Scrum and Kanban software development methodologies as appropriate for their
                        respective
                        projects. Working closely with the developers, I performed business and data analysis, and
                        trained
                        end-users on the systems’ usage. I used JIRA, Asana and Trello to create and assign stories and
                        deliverables
                        to developers.
                        <br />
                        <br /> A key part of my job was stakeholder management. I was responsible for ensuring that the
                        product
                        roadmap for each project accurately reflected the stakeholders’ concerns, and that they were
                        kept
                        up to date with the statuses of their issues. Furthermore, I was very commonly responsible for
                        sourcing
                        and negotiating third party contracts for the resources required in the development and
                        operation
                        of our projects. As a key member of the leadership team I worked closely with the CEO on funding
                        projects, as well as brand recognition projects by creating presentations, running workshops, as
                        well as hosting numerous events on digital marketing.

                                        I managed the launch of a new business arm aimed at digital marketing for the
                                        hospitality sector. I negotiated with the clients
                                        and the internal sales team to ensure we weren't over promising and that our

                                        As Product Owner, I navigated a challenging period without a CTO or Head of
                                        Engineering, leading the creation of a critical pricing algorithm for our hotel
                                        contract system. This was essential for bridging communication gaps with our junior,
                                        non-English speaking development team, converting intricate paper contracts into a
                                        systematic, digital format. My role was crucial in developing an automated system
                                        that accurately reflected room pricing, occupancy, and special offers.

                                        Upon the arrival of the technical leadership, I continued in my Product Owner role,

                                        multiple suppliers. This phase expanded the system's capabilities, leveraging
                                        real-time data for enhanced operational efficiency.

                            as "servant leaders," helping the rest of the Scrum team work together and learn the Scrum

                            CSMs also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. Read more about the
